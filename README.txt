; Purpose of Program:	Classic game of blockade written in 6502 assembly. 
;			Two player game. Drive the snakes around the screen 
;			for as long as possible without colliding with any 
;			surfaces. The first player to collide with anything
; 			loses. Have a good time. 
; Specifics:		Game should be run using "Symon Simulator version 
;			1.1.0" locally on a Microsoft Windows operating system
;			and assembled using SB-Assembler "sbasm". 6502.org
;			and easy6502.com were referenced and adapted from 
;  			during production of this program.
; ***Note:		Should the game run too fast or too slow on your system,
;		        the stall subroutine can be fiddled with to allow more
;			or less NOP's to better fit your computer speed.
