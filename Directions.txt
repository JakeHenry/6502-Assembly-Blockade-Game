1) Download and extract the master .zip file.
2) Run the symon-1.1.0-SS.jar executable.
3) If editing the blockade.asm code, you will need to install sbasm (SB-Assembler)
   in order to compile your new code. Reference sbprojects.com and the link provided
   in the SB-Assembler_sbasm_info.txt file I have provided.
4) To compile, make sure you save your edited blockade.asm file, 
   set up sbasm and simply type sbasm <filename> in a command prompt. It will
   generate a new file called 'blockade.prg' or similar in the working directory
   of your command prompt.
   If you just want to use the program I have provided and don't plan on editing the code,
   then don't worry about this. I have provided a precompiled blockade.prg file in the master.
5) In the symon simulator, click 'File' -> ' Program...' and then navigate to where
   the blockade.prg file is. This is the compiled program file. Open it.
6) Click 'View' -> 'Video Window' and then click the 'Run' button on the simulator.
   Make sure to keep the simulator window, NOT the video window, in the foreground
   so that keyboard input will be registered. 
   
Note: If the game runs too fast, add more NOP operators in the 'stall' subroutine of 
blockade.asm as needed until your computer's speed makes the game playable. You may need 
to remove some NOP operators as well if it runs too slow. Basically, manipulate the 'stall' 
method as needed.
